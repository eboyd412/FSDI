    <h1> <bold>The Interlude</bold> </h1>
    <p> <sub>As someone who's coming up on 5 years in IT</sub>, I'm starting to grow timid of becoming replaceable with the rise of automation 
    and I wanted to stay competetitive in the face of the future. <small> I come from not having much, and feel very lucky to just be in the technology space.</small> 
    I want to gain all the skills possible to land a high paying developer job, and <del>continue growing in the technology space</del>. </p>
